# CQ_BattleScript

You can play the game at:
https://www.kongregate.com/games/GaiaByte/cosmos-quest

We decided to make or battle code public in order to ease the task of getting it everytime we update the game.
This should give you a fast way to have your tools up-to-date, and forget about reimplementing our code and focus more on improving your tools.
You can send us push requests if you want, we'll look at them.

Thanks,
GaiaByte Team
